<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="../data/mathComparison.csv">these data</a> on Math improvement scores.<br/>
Use random effects for school, class (within school) as well as 
 for the individual pupil. We want a model for mathgain based on the other variables (or a subset of these).  These students were randomly selected.
a. Which potential predictor variables were measured on the schools? which on classrooms (or the teacher)?  which on individuals?<br/>
b.  Fit with appropriate mixed effects model. Explain what fixed and random terms you will use.  Interpret resuts from your fit.  Show diagnostic plots and discuss what you see.<br/>
c.  Fit the same model using MCMC software.  Explain how interpretation changes for the Bayesian approach.  </p>

<p>Turn in a complete report explaining the influences of predictors and comparing variances at different levels.  Include a complete description of the model you feel is appropriate for these data, the inferences you draw from the model, and an examination and discussion of appropriate diagnostics.</p>

<p>variables:<br/>
sex, minority status (yes = 1, 0 = no), SES, and 3 ID variables are self explanatory<br/>
mathPrescore was measured in kindergarten<br/>
mathGain is the response of interest: improvement in the last year.
povertyRate is the proportion of kids qualifing for free lunch<br/>
teachrXper = number of years of experience<br/>
teachrMath is a score of his/her mathematics knowledge<br/>
teacherMathprep rates the math classes the teacher has taken.  </p></li>
<li><p><a href="../data/mathImprovement.csv">Another study</a> followed 500 randomly selected  kids through four grades to track their math achievement scores.<br/>
Do preliminary exploration in lme or lmer, but I want your report on these data to be based solely on a JAGs fit.  That includes diagnostics to evaluate the assumptions of the model.<br/>
We want a complete description of how math scores change (hopefully improve) over time for the population of kids from which these 500 are selected.<br/>
After explaining your model, derive the correlation between grade i and grade j scores for the same individual from the MCMC output (for each i, j pair).  Compare to lme or lmer estimates.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: I did not say anything about plots.  That does not mean that I don&#39;t want to see plots.  I do.  </p>

<p>Turn in a comlpete report (pdf or html) of your findings.  Include the important parts of your code as an appendix.  Include appropriate plots and output near where you discuss them.    </p>
